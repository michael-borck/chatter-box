# ChatterBox for Teachers

Welcome, educators! ChatterBox is a powerful tool for creating engaging conversation practice experiences for your students. This guide will help you leverage ChatterBox to enhance your curriculum.

## Quick Start for Teachers

### Your Teaching Workflow
1. **[Create scenarios](#creating-curriculum-scenarios)** tailored to your learning objectives
2. **[Build practice packs](#building-curriculum-packs)** that organize scenarios into structured learning paths
3. **[Export and share](#sharing-with-students)** content with students
4. **[Guide student practice](#supporting-student-learning)** and monitor progress concepts

## Creating Curriculum Scenarios

### Educational Scenario Design

#### Academic Scenarios
Perfect for subject-specific communication:
- **Language Learning**: Conversation practice in target language
- **Business Communication**: Professional interaction skills
- **STEM Presentations**: Explaining technical concepts
- **Medical Communication**: Patient interaction practice
- **Legal Studies**: Client consultation scenarios

#### Example: Business Communication Scenario
```
Name: "Client Project Update Meeting"
Description: "Lead a project status meeting with a demanding client"
Category: "Business Communication"
Difficulty: "Intermediate"
Duration: "15 minutes"

System Prompt: "You are a concerned client asking detailed questions about project delays, budget concerns, and timeline changes. Be professional but firm about your expectations."

Initial Message: "Good morning. I've been reviewing the project status report you sent, and I have some serious concerns about the delays we're seeing. Can you walk me through what's happening?"
```

### Curriculum Integration Tips

#### Align with Learning Objectives
- **Map scenarios to course goals**: Each scenario should practice specific skills
- **Progressive difficulty**: Start simple, build complexity

   - Problem-solving scenarios
   - Handling disagreements
   - Giving and receiving feedback

3. **Advanced Pack**: Complex situations
   - Multi-stakeholder scenarios
   - Crisis communication
   - Leadership and facilitation

#### Subject-Specific Sequences
- **Business Sequence**: Networking → Meetings → Presentations → Negotiations
- **Medical Sequence**: Patient intake → Diagnosis discussion → Treatment explanation → Follow-up
- **Education Sequence**: Lesson planning → Parent conferences → Administrative meetings

### Pack Organization Strategies

#### Thematic Organization
- **Color coding**: Use pack colors to represent different themes or difficulty levels
- **Clear naming**: Use descriptive names that indicate content and level
- **Logical ordering**: Arrange scenarios within packs to build skills progressively
