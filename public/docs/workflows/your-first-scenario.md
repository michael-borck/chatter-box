## Choose Your First Scenario

This scenario is perfect for beginners because:

### Access the Scenario

1. **Open Talk Buddy** if it's not already running
2. **Click "Scenarios"** in the sidebar navigation
3. **Find "Customer Service - Product Return"** in the list
4. **Read the description**: 
   > "Handle a customer service situation involving a product return or complaint. Practice professional problem-solving."
