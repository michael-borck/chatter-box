- Check if packs are archived
- Create a new pack to populate the section

### Quick Start Not Working
- Ensure you have at least one active (non-archived) scenario
- Check that scenarios aren't corrupted (try viewing one individually)
- Restart ChatterBox if the issue persists

### Performance Issues
- **Slow loading**: Check if you have many scenarios (consider archiving old ones)
- **Outdated content**: Refresh by navigating away and back to Home
