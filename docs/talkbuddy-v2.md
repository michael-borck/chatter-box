The ChatterBox V2 system will incorporate a user registration and login system, providing authenticated access to personalized features.

### User Dashboard Enhancements

The existing Dashboard will be expanded to serve as a central hub for authenticated users. It will include:

* **Conversation Management**: Users can easily initiate new conversations and review their recent practice sessions.
* **Scenario Selection**:
    * **Quick Select**: A dedicated section will allow users to quickly choose from scenarios they have created or from public scenarios available in the library.
* **Scenario Management**:
    * **Edit/Create Scenarios**: Users will have the ability to create new interview scenarios from scratch or modify existing ones they own. This involves defining the scenario name, description, category, difficulty, estimated duration, system prompt, initial AI message, and tags.
    * **Upload Scenario**: A feature to upload scenarios, likely in a simple Markdown format, will be provided. This is particularly useful for instructors or lecturers to supply pre-defined practice scenarios to their students.
    * **Download Scenario**: Users, presumably those who supplied scenarios, will also have the option to download their scenarios.
* **Conversation Analysis**: Beyond just transcript review, the dashboard will present charts and plots to visualize conversation analysis data, such as words per minute, filler words, and clarity, providing insights into user performance.

### User Interface Implications

The introduction of user accounts and scenario management will necessitate additional screens and UI elements beyond the core conversation interface:

* **Login/Registration Screens**: Standard forms for user sign-up and login.
* **My Scenarios Screen**: A dedicated screen where users can view, create, edit, upload, and download scenarios they own. This would likely resemble the existing "Scenarios Library" but with additional controls for personal scenarios.
* **Analytics/Performance Screen**: A screen dedicated to displaying the charts and plots for conversation analysis, linked from the session history or dashboard.

This approach avoids a full classroom management system, focusing instead on individual user flexibility for scenario creation and practice, with enhanced feedback through conversation analysis.
