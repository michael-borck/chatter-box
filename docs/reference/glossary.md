# Glossary

Comprehensive reference of terms, concepts, and technical language used in ChatterBox and conversation practice.

## Core Concepts

### **AI (Artificial Intelligence)**
Computer systems that simulate human-like conversation and responses. In ChatterBox, AI powers the conversation partners that respond to your practice.

### **ChatterBox**
The conversation practice application that combines AI, speech recognition, and voice synthesis to create realistic practice scenarios.

### **Conversation Practice**
Structured dialogue exercises designed to improve communication skills through realistic interaction with AI-powered conversation partners.

### **Practice Pack**
A curated collection of related scenarios organized into a learning sequence. Also called "Skill Package."

### **Scenario**
A specific conversation practice situation with defined context, objectives, and AI character behavior.

### **Session**
A single practice conversation within a scenario, from start to completion.

## Speech and Audio Technology

### **STT (Speech-to-Text)**
Technology that converts spoken words into written text. Enables ChatterBox to understand what you say during practice.

### **TTS (Text-to-Speech)**
Technology that converts written text into spoken audio. Allows AI responses to be heard as voice output.

### **Voice Synthesis**
The process of generating human-like speech from text using artificial intelligence or recorded speech patterns.

### **Speech Recognition**
The ability of a computer system to identify and process human speech input. Used for STT functionality.

### **Audio Latency**
The delay between input and output in audio processing. Lower latency means more natural conversation flow.

### **Voice Model**
Specific configuration of TTS system that determines voice characteristics like accent, gender, and speaking style.

## AI and Language Models

### **LLM (Large Language Model)**
Advanced AI systems trained on vast amounts of text to understand and generate human-like language responses.

### **Context Window**
The amount of previous conversation that an AI model can remember and reference when generating responses.

### **Temperature**
AI parameter controlling response creativity and randomness. Lower values produce more focused responses; higher values more creative ones.

### **Prompt**
Instructions or context given to an AI model to guide its behavior and responses in a scenario.

### **Character Instructions**
Specific guidelines that define how an AI should behave, speak, and respond within a particular scenario role.

Local speech service that provides both speech recognition (STT) and voice synthesis (TTS) capabilities.

## File Formats and Data

### **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**
Text-based file format used for exporting and importing scenarios and practice packs in ChatterBox.

### **Export**
Process of saving scenarios or practice packs to files that can be shared with others or backed up.

### **Import**
Process of loading scenarios or practice packs from files created by ChatterBox exports.

### **Database**
Local storage system where ChatterBox keeps all scenarios, practice packs, and user data.
